    <div class="section">
        <h2>4. User Consent (GDPR & UMP)</h2>
        <p>
            Before showing ads to users located in the European Economic Area (EEA), the United Kingdom, and Switzerland,
            we request user consent for personalized advertising using Google’s <strong>User Messaging Platform (UMP)</strong>.

            <li>Personalized advertising</li>
            <li>Or receive only non-personalized ads</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This choice can be changed at any time from the device privacy settings where applicable.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>
            We do not store any personal data on our servers.
            Third-party services retain data only as long as necessary for their operational purposes,
            such as analytics, ad delivery, or fraud prevention.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
        <p>
            While we do not collect or store data ourselves, we rely on industry-leading partners (Google, Unity, ironSource)
            that implement strong security measures to protect the information they process.
        </p>
